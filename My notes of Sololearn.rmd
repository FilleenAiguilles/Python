# Basic Concepts

## Simple Operations
Python also carries out multiplication and division, using an asterisk to indicate multiplication and a forward slash to indicate division.
```
>>> 2 * (3 + 4)
14
>>> 10 / 2
5.0
```
Dividing by zero in Python produces an error, as no answer can be calculated.
```
>>> 11 / 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```
**In Python, the last line of an error message indicates the error's type.Read error messages carefully, as they often tell you how to fix a program!**
Floats are used in Python to represent numbers that aren't integers. 
```
>>> 3/4
0.75
```
Besides addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, Python also supports exponentiation, which is the raising of one number to the power of another. This operation is performed using two asterisks.
```
>>> 2**5
32
>>> 9 ** (1/2)
3.0
```
## Quotient & Remainder
To determine the quotient and remainder of a division, use the floor division and modulo operators, respectively. 
Floor division is done using two forward slashes.The modulo operator is carried out with a percent symbol (%)
```
>>> 20 // 6
3
>>> 1.25 % 0.5
0.25
```
## Strings
If you want to use text in Python, you have to use a string. A string is created by entering text between two single or double quotation marks.
Some characters can't be directly included in a string. For instance, double quotes can't be directly included in a double quote string; Characters like these must be escaped by placing a backslash before them. Other common characters that must be escaped are newlines and backslashes. Double quotes only need to be escaped in double quote strings, and the same is true for single quote strings.
```
>>> 'Brian\'s mother: He\'s not the Messiah. He\'s a very naughty boy!'
'Brian's mother: He's not the Messiah. He's a very naughty boy!'
```
## Newlines
Python provides an easy way to avoid manually writing "\n" to escape newlines in a string. Create a string with three sets of quotes, and newlines that are created by pressing Enter are automatically escaped for you.
```
>>> """Customer: Good morning.
Owner: Good morning, Sir. Welcome to the National Cheese Emporium."""

'Customer: Good morning.\nOwner: Good morning, Sir. Welcome to the National Cheese Emporium.'
```
