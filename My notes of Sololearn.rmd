## Simple Operations
Python also carries out multiplication and division, using an asterisk to indicate multiplication and a forward slash to indicate division.
```
>>> 2 * (3 + 4)
14
>>> 10 / 2
5.0
```
Dividing by zero in Python produces an error, as no answer can be calculated.
```
>>> 11 / 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```
** In Python, the last line of an error message indicates the error's type.Read error messages carefully, as they often tell you how to fix a program! **
